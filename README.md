# PhasmophobiaOverlay
## Description
This is a Phasmophobia overlay for streamers that shows clues found, possible ghosts, and clues that should be searched for.

## Instructions

### Initial Setup

To use script simply scroll down to the line where you see `ComfyJS.Init( "{{ user }}" );` and change that field to your username. For example I would change `ComfyJS.Init( "{{ user }}" );` to `ComfyJS.Init( "Rune911" );`

### Use in OBS.

Add this script as a web source in obs. From there it will look for chat commands from the broadcaster, mods, or vip

### Interact with your Viewers!

- Valid commands are !orbs, !freezing, !fingerprints, !box, !writing, and !emf.
- When a new clue is found just enter that clue.
- To clear the overlay use !phasmo-reset
